## 🚀 Featured Engineering Projects

### 1. ContentGenie AI Pipeline
* **Distributed Architecture:** Built with FastAPI, utilizing **Celery & Redis** for asynchronous background task orchestration.
* **AI Intelligence:** Multi-stage reasoning pipeline (Scrapy + GPT-4o) for data nomination, validation, and enrichment.
* **Live SEO Feedback:** Deep integration with **Google Search Console API** for real-time performance tracking (Clicks/Impressions).
* **The Tech:** Docker, React, FastAPI, Redis, Celery, OpenAI API.

### 2. Autonomous Market Intelligence Engine (Scrapy + GPT-4o)
**Industrial-Grade Web Crawler & AI Content Generator**
- **The Engine:** A high-concurrency **Scrapy** framework designed for deep-web crawling of dynamic marketplace listings.
- **AI Logic:** Implemented a **Nominate → Validate → Generate** reasoning loop. The system autonomously identifies market competitors and validates them against local caches before generating AI comparison content.
- **Self-Healing Data:** Built a specialized caching layer that repairs data integrity issues in real-time, reducing manual database maintenance by 90%.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Scrapy, GPT-4o, WooCommerce REST API, PIL (WebP Processing).

### 3. Custom WordPress Infrastructure & Plugin Suite
**High-Performance CMS Engineering for E-commerce & Tech Portals**
* **Smartphone Specs Engine (GadgetPH):** A bespoke indexing system for 500+ technical datasheets. I engineered an AJAX-driven batch processor that reduced cache-rebuild server load and improved page speeds by 70%.
* **Marketplace Sync Plugins:** Custom-built bridges connecting WooCommerce to external marketplaces (Shopee/Lazada), ensuring stock and price parity.
* **Batch Analytics Plugin:** Developed a specialized plugin utilizing the **WordPress Transients API** to aggregate complex data points without degrading front-end performance.

### 4. Price Intelligence & Volatility Tracker
**Real-time Marketplace Monitoring System**
* **The Tech:** Python (Scrapy), MySQL, D3.js.
* **Outcome:** Built a self-healing scraper that monitors price fluctuations across 1,000+ listings, visualized through dynamic SVG charts.
